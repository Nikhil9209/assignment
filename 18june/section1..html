    <h2> Overview</h2>
    <P>Scam: From Harshad Mehta to Ketan Parekh is a gripping non-fiction book written by journalists<B> Debashis Basu and Sucheta Dalal</B> . The book offers a detailed and insightful account of two of the biggest financial scandals in <mark>India's history—the 1992 securities scam involving Harshad Mehta and the 2001 stock market scam involving Ketan Parekh </mark>. It exposes the murky nexus between stockbrokers, bankers, bureaucrats, and politicians that allowed these scams to flourish. The authors meticulously trace how systemic loopholes, regulatory failures, and unchecked greed led to the manipulation of stock prices and the siphoning of huge sums of money from the banking system. The book not only narrates how Harshad Mehta exploited the banking system to fund a stock market bubble but also how, a decade later, Ketan Parekh used similar tactics with newer methods to rig stock prices. Beyond exposing the scams, the book critically examines the shortcomings of India’s financial regulatory institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of inadequate financial oversight and remains relevant for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of financial crime in India.</P>
    <h2> CH-1 The Scam Surfaces</h2>
        <p>The chapter begins with a tense encounter between Kamat, an SBI official, and Sitaraman, another officer suspected of irregularities in government securities transactions. Kamat, accompanied by his wife, waits patiently for hours until Sitaraman arrives. When they meet, Sitaraman appears deeply disturbed and anxious. Kamat informs him that Khemani, another senior SBI official, has asked for him to return to Bombay immediately to explain a serious discrepancy. Initially silent, Sitaraman later agrees and returns with Kamat, taking his wife and son along.</p>
        <p>Back in Bombay, during a flight with Kamat, Sitaraman insists he has the SGLs (Subsidiary General Ledger accounts)—the crucial proof of actual securities transactions. However, during a meeting at SBI’s Nariman Point head office, Sitaraman is cornered by Kamat and Khemani and finally admits he only has BRs (Bank Receipts), not SGLs. BRs, unlike SGLs, are not official proof of government securities being held; they are mere promises. Sitaraman tries to deflect questions, claiming another broker, Harshad, had the BRs and had promised to deliver SGLs. His story seems unconvincing, and Khemani grows more suspicious.</p>
        <p>Days pass, and Khemani keeps pressing for the reconciliation statement to verify the transactions. Sitaraman keeps delaying, claiming the Bombay main branch needs more time. Meanwhile, he’s desperately trying to adjust the books to hide the discrepancies. Eventually, on April 6th, a statement arrives. When Khemani reviews it, he finds major red flags: overwriting, unauthorized changes, and a ₹74 crore discrepancy between what Sitaraman claimed (₹1744.95 crore) and what the Public Debt Office (PDO) reported (₹1670.95 crore). Khemani realizes this isn’t just a clerical error—it’s fraud. He involves TPN Rao, another senior official, to crosscheck SBI’s records against the RBI's official figures.</p>
        <p>Rao confronts Sitaraman, who at first tries to avoid going to the PDO by claiming personal responsibilities. Eventually, Rao convinces him to visit. At the PDO, the worst fears are confirmed: the official record shows SBI only transacted ₹1170.95 crore, not ₹1760.95 crore, indicating that someone had forged records to inflate transaction values. It becomes clear that this fraud happened within the walls of India's most trusted financial institution.</p>
        <p> The chapter concludes by showing the broader shockwaves. Investigations begin, with the RBI and the CBI stepping in. Despite the magnitude of the scam, many of the real culprits—including brokers—remain untouched, while treasury staff face harassment. Sitaraman goes on leave and never returns. It is later found that SBI’s shortfall of ₹14 crore stemmed from securities it never received from Punjab National Bank and State Bank of Patiala. The scam had surfaced, but the layers of manipulation, cover-ups, and systemic failures had only begun to unravel.,</p>

<h2> CH-2 Bank, Broker, Sucker,Thief </h2>
    <P>The chapter begins by explaining the triangular structure of transactions between banks, brokers, and government securities. Ideally, banks were only supposed to deal directly with each other in government securities transactions. Brokers were meant to act merely as facilitators, helping connect one bank to another. However, in practice, brokers like Harshad Mehta became central players, often controlling both sides of the transaction, and even receiving securities or funds directly—something that violated RBI guidelines</P>
    <P>The loophole that enabled the scam involved Bank Receipts (BRs). These were supposed to be temporary instruments issued by banks when they couldn't immediately deliver securities. But brokers started misusing BRs. Instead of acting as a short-term document, BRs were being issued without backing securities—effectively allowing brokers to create money out of thin air. Banks, in turn, accepted these BRs without verifying whether they were backed by actual securities or not</P>
    <P>Brokers like Harshad Mehta exploited the blind trust that existed between banks. He would assure one bank that he was handling a securities deal on behalf of another bank, while simultaneously telling the second bank the same thing. The broker would then get access to funds from one bank (through a fake or unsecured BR), and use that money to manipulate the stock market, particularly to inflate the prices of select stocks. This created a fake boom, driven not by market fundamentals but by stolen funds.</P>
    <P>In this web of deceit, public sector banks—especially their treasury departments—became the real "suckers." They were left holding fake BRs or empty promises of future securities, while their money had already been siphoned off by brokers. These banks suffered huge losses, and many didn’t even realize they were victims until weeks later, during reconciliation. This showed both the lack of internal controls and the over-dependence on brokers in the banking system</P>
    <P>The chapter closes by emphasizing how this wasn’t just the fault of one or two greedy brokers. It was a systemic failure. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), despite having regulations in place, failed to enforce them. Banks failed to follow basic accounting and verification procedures. The government, too, was slow to react. This regulatory blindness and bureaucratic laziness allowed the scam to spread like wildfire, causing one of the worst financial frauds in Indian history</P>
<h2> CH-3 Creed of Greed</h2>
    <p> The title itself—Creed of Greed—suggests that greed had become a kind of religion for many brokers, bankers, and investors. The financial markets, during the early 1990s liberalization period, were gripped by a hunger for quick wealth. People weren’t interested in sound investments—they wanted skyrocketing returns. This emotional vulnerability was fertile ground for manipulation.</p>
    <p>Harshad Mehta is presented not just as a fraudster but as a product of the system. He started as a small-time broker and rose rapidly by exploiting inefficiencies and loopholes in the banking and securities systems. He used charm, confidence, and big bets to attract attention and gain the trust of major banks. His ability to move hundreds of crores without raising alarms made him a star in Dalal Street.</p>
    <p>Mehta understood that perception drives prices. Once he gained access to funds through fake BRs and SGLs, he poured money into the stock market—especially into specific “favored” stocks. This created a bull run, where stock prices kept rising rapidly. Other investors, seeing the rise, rushed in too, making the prices shoot up even further. It was a classic case of market manipulation disguised as smart investing.</p>
    <p>Public sector banks, meant to be cautious and conservative, also got caught in the greed trap. Treasury heads were judged by the profits they brought in, not the safety of funds. As a result, they began relying blindly on brokers like Mehta to deliver quick returns. No one questioned how he could promise such high yields—because everyone was making money</p>
    <p>The chapter points out that institutions like the RBI, SEBI, and the Finance Ministry failed to act—even when irregularities were evident. Some were too slow, some were unaware, and some were simply indifferent. A few were even complicit. Regulations existed, but enforcement was lax. The belief was: as long as the stock market was booming, all was well.</p>
    <p>The final section of the chapter reflects on the missed warning signs. There were multiple points where someone could have intervened—auditors, regulators, even internal SBI officials. But nobody wanted to disturb the golden goose. The market was rising, profits were flowing, and greed had blinded everyone to reality.</p>
